        <h1>paragraph tag</h1>
       <p>A paragraph in HTML is simply a block of text enclosed within the 'p' tag. <br>
        The 'p' tag helps divide content into manageable, readable sections.<br>
         It's the go-to element for wrapping text in a web page that is meant to be displayed as a distinct paragraph.
